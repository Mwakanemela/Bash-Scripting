echo $SHELL - to know which bash you are using either bin bash or zsh

which bash or which zsh - to know what to execute to switch to bin bash or zsh -(this didnot work for me)

(so i used this and it worked)
if point 2 does not work while using sudo create a backup of /etc/passwd using cp(copy) command then edit /etc/passwd the last line change zsh to bash the logout and login again

create a script file with .sh extension, write your script then make it executable by using chmod +x filename.extension
